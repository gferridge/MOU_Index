# MOU_Index

This code generates the MOU Index, a metric for the direct comparison of soccer managers based on their relative performance in the DAVIES statistic. 

The major code can be found in MOU_Index_Final.Rmd. This file, combined with the data in the repository, will generate the index values for managers.

When run, the total manager values of the index can be found in the ordered dataframe managers_index_all_seasons.

The manager values separated by position group can be found under the "corrected_index". The code is inefficient but successfully generates these values. It will be tidied for proceding versions.
